Description: This R package contains a set of functions for conducting Conjunctive Analysis of Case Configurations (CACC) (Miethe, Hart, & Regoeczi, 2008) and for identifying and quantifying situational clustering in dominant case configurations (Hart, 2019). Initially conceived as an exploratory technique for multivariate analysis of categorical data, CACC has developed to include formal statistical tests that can be applied in a wide variety of contexts. This technique allows the examination of composite profiles, which serve as the unit of analysis, as an alternative to variable-oriented analytic methods.
